    <p class="questtext">Quarter note triplets starting from the + of 1 are tricky and weird, <br>and studying them can give great insight into the subtle psychology of how music is written.
        In graduate school,<br> one of my professors wrote this rhythm up on the board and challenged us to figure it out. I couldn't,<br> so I brought it home and showed it to my drummer roommate, who immediately broke it down like you see it in the video. <br>It's tricky, but breaking things down to their component parts can aid in performing really weird rhythms like this one.</p>
