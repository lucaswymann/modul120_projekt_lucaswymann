<div class="quest1"><h2 align="center" class="quest"> Question</h2><br>

    <p class="questtext">I'm curious which one is better sound-wise, I don't care that much about functionality.<br> I'm looking for a thick vintage-y sound that is not too cold/digital and sounds good in final mixes.<br> I tried the Serum demo hands-on, and listened to a lot of Sylenth1 demos on youtube but still hesitant to decide.<br> Anyways, what is your experience? (mind you I'm curious about the sound/sound quality not the number of functions,<br> Serum is clearly a winner in that case)</p>

    <p class="questtext">I think serum is an amazing synth because it shows you your wavetables to give you a visual of how you are affecting them. <br>I have tried to use sylenth but I feel that it is a bit messy for me.<br> I think that serum is very well labeled, planed out, and easy to figure out.<br> Don't take this from me though. Everyone has their opinion and frankly either one is great.<br> Get both the demos and mess around with both. I still would say serum is a better option.<br> I have only been producing for almost 3 years now and am getting deeper into sound design,<br> and I have to say that serum has made part of that journey very easy.</p>
